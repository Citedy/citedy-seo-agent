Each focused skill includes the same setup flow and works standalone. Install the full suite above for all capabilities.

## TinyClaw Install

Use the dedicated guide:

- [TINYCLAW.md](./TINYCLAW.md)

## AutoGPT Quickstart

1. Open `./autogpt/README.md`.
2. Import a template from `./autogpt/agents/*.agent.json`.
3. Run with:

- `API Key` = `citedy_agent_...`
- `Request JSON` = payload for selected workflow

## Getting Started

### 1. Add the Skill to Your Agent

Import this repository into your AI agent platform. For Manus, use **"Import from GitHub"** and point to this repo.

### 2. Register Your Agent

Once the skill is active, your agent will guide you through a one-time setup:

1. The agent calls the Citedy registration API
2. You receive an approval link — open it in your browser
3. Copy the API key and paste it back to your agent

That's it. Your agent is now connected to Citedy and ready to create content.

## How It Works

The Citedy SEO Agent provides a simple yet powerful workflow for creating and distributing content:

1. **Scout.** Discover trending topics or analyze competitors to find content opportunities.
2. **Generate.** Create a high-quality, SEO-optimized article based on your research.
3. **Enhance.** Add AI-generated illustrations and voice-over to make your content stand out.
4. **Adapt & Distribute.** Automatically adapt your article for social media and publish it to your connected accounts.

This entire process can be automated with cron-based sessions, allowing you to create a set-and-forget content machine that works for you 24/7.

## Optional X/Twitter Source Context

OpenClaw users who already use
[TweetClaw](https://github.com/Xquik-dev/tweetclaw) can pass a reviewed
X/Twitter source pack into Citedy before running trend scouting, article
generation, or social adaptation. This is useful when the brief depends on
specific tweet URLs, reply excerpts, public metrics, user lookup notes,
follower-export summaries, media references, monitor snapshots, or webhook
events.

```bash
openclaw plugins install npm:@xquik/tweetclaw
```

Treat TweetClaw output as source material only. Citedy remains responsible for
topic selection, article generation, social adaptations, publishing, scheduling,
webhooks, and analytics. Keep TweetClaw write-like actions such as posts,
replies, DMs, follows, media uploads, monitor creation, and giveaway draws in
the TweetClaw/OpenClaw approval flow, and do not paste API keys, cookies,
browser profiles, or raw session material into prompts, logs, issues, or
commits.
